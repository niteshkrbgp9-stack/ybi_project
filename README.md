Purchase_Prediction_And_MicroNumerosity
Description

This project is developed as part of the YBI Foundation Internship Program. It focuses on predicting customer purchase behavior using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical customer data, the model identifies patterns that help determine whether a customer is likely to make a purchase.

The project also incorporates the concept of MicroNumerosity, which enables the analysis of small-scale numerical patterns in customer behavior to improve prediction accuracy.
